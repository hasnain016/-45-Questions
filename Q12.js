// 12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message
// should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
// Store the names of friends in an array called names
var names1 = ["Ali", "Naveed", "Kamran", "Irshad", "Hasnain"];
var massage1 = "is a Good Person and IT Engenior!";
// Print each person's name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time
for (var i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
    console.log(names[i] + ":  ".concat(massage));
}
