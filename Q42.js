// 42. Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39.
// Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding
// the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to
// see that the list has actually been modified.
// solution=>
function show_magicians(magicians) {
    magicians.forEach(function (magician) { return console.log(magician); });
